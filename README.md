# Power-BI Projects
1. Sales Data Analysis:
I undertook a comprehensive sales data analysis project, leveraging Python for data processing, Excel for data visualization, and Power BI for insightful reporting. This project involved dissecting sales trends, identifying key performance indicators, and optimizing sales strategies. The outcome empowered decision-makers with actionable insights to boost revenue and enhance market competitiveness.

2. Diabetes Data Analysis:
In another impactful endeavor, I conducted a meticulous analysis of diabetes-related data. Utilizing Python, Excel, and Power BI, we delved into patient records, identified risk factors, and crafted predictive models for early intervention. This project aimed to improve patient care, streamline healthcare resources, and contribute to the advancement of diabetes management.

3. HR Attrition Analytics:
I executed an HR attrition analytics project, utilizing Python, Excel, and Power BI to examine workforce dynamics. Through in-depth analysis, we identified patterns leading to employee attrition, proposed retention strategies, and optimized HR policies. This project fostered a more stable and engaged workforce, ultimately benefiting the organization's productivity and employee satisfaction.

4.Indian-Crime-Acitivity-Dashboard (2019-21)
The data provided from data.gov.in website includes several key indicators related to crime in India from 2019-2021. These indicators include the average rate of crime against women, the average rate of crime against children, the average of total murder and kidnapping, the average rate of cognizable crime, and the average of violent crime rate. Additionally, the dataset includes information on the type of complaints received, the total number of complaints, and a crime map of India.

This information is crucial in creating a comprehensive and detailed dashboard on Indian crime from 2019-2021. By visualizing this data, it is possible to identify trends and patterns in crime rates across different regions and demographics. For example, by comparing the average rates of crime against women and children, it is possible to identify areas where targeted interventions may be necessary. Similarly, by analyzing the type of complaints received, it is possible to identify areas where additional resources may be needed to address specific types of crimes.

Overall, this data provides a rich and detailed picture of crime in India from 2019-2021. By incorporating this information into a power BI dashboard, it is possible to create a powerful tool for visualizing and analyzing crime data in real-time, enabling policymakers and law enforcement agencies to make informed decisions to improve public safety and reduce crime rates.
